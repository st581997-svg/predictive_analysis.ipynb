# Task : Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
I built a Linear Regression model to predict **Medical Expenses** based on hospital data.

## Steps Performed
* **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and date formatting.
* **Feature Engineering:** Calculated 'Stay Duration' from admission dates.
* **Feature Selection:** Used a correlation heatmap to identify key drivers of cost.
* **Evaluation:** Achieved an R-squared score of -0.0988.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
